# Spring-Boot-Web-project
---

Project where I'll be exerimenting with Spring Boot Web capabilities and testing out what it can do, learning as I go through it.

I will explain more clearly what I did here and why the annotations where used in those places, what their role is and how they interact with each other.

### 1. Project purpose

This project's main purpose is to allow me (and any other person reading the code and tinkering with it) t learn about Spring Boot, more specifically about the web framework.
