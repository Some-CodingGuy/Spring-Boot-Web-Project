# Spring-Boot-Web-project
---

Project where I'll be exerimenting with Spring Boot Web capabilities and testing out what it can do, learning as I go through it.

I will explain more clearly what I did here and why the annotations where used in those places, what their role is and how they interact with each other.

But, as for now I will first finish it completely, then I'll go through it and make a full description of the project.


As for now, the project uses a local database that is in a docker container. (The information to connect to the database is in /src/main/resources/application.yml)
But you can also spin up a server in a VPS (virtual private server), set up the database in the server, and update the "application.yml" file with the details of the server and the user in the database that you want to make the changes.
